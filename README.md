Sketch.io is a collaborative drawing and guessing game where users can create rooms, invite friends, and play a game similar to *Scribble.io*. The main objective is for one player to draw a chosen word while other players guess the word through chat. Unique features include reconnection support and a points retention system to enhance the gaming experience.

## Features

- **Create and Join Rooms**: Set up a private room and invite friends to play
- **Drawing and Guessing Game**: The drawer selects a word from three options and sketches it on a canvas; other players guess the word in real-time
- **Intelligent Chat Feedback**: Guesses appear in the chat with color indicators based on closeness to the correct word; correct guesses are hidden for suspense
- **Reconnection Support**: If a player disconnects, they have 2 minutes 30 seconds to reconnect without losing points
